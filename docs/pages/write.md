# Writing

This section contains examples of different types of topic and writing for different audiences.

## Install OMT

This example aims to demonstrate different levels of detail aimed at different levels of experience.

- "Install OMT" is a reference topic that guides users through the (long) installation process.
- "Prepare an environment to install OMT" describes the how to configure the environment at a very high level. This topic is aimed at experienced users who have installed OMT before. They need to know what to do, but not how to do it.
- The three child topics are examples of task topics. They're aimed at less experienced users who need more support to configure the environment. The topics contain step-by-step instructions for the tasks described in "Prepare an environment to install OMT."

OMT is a Kubernetes-based platform, on which other products (such as Service Management) are deployed and managed.

## Service Management record models

This example includes a concept landing page and a number of task-based child topics.  

Models are essentially templates that can be applied when creating different types of record in Service Management. The content and function of these models differ according to the module (and record type) in Service Management. These examples are from the Service Level Agreement module.

## Dev2Prod REST API

An example of reference API documentation. 

The Dev2Prod REST API enables users to synchronize two Service Management environments (typically, development and production environments) without using the GUI.
