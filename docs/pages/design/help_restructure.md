The decision to make an internal document publically-visible presented an opportunity to restructure it for clarity, navigability, and SEO.

A content audit and workshops with SMEs enabled me to:

- Reduce the total number of topics by over a third (491 down to 315)
- Identify and remove  obsolete troubleshooting topics
- Merge 4 installtion sub-sections into a single user journey
- Focused review sessions with SMEs identified X% of troubleshooting topics to be redundant 141/129
- Reduce the maximum depth of the ToC to 3 (down from X)
