I'm a tech writer and editor with 14+ years of experience in technical documentation. Currently at OpenText, I mainly work on IT Service Management products and a Kubernetes-based container orchestration platform.

Also an occassional cycling coach and one-time archaeologist.

You can contact me at [edcork@gmail.com](edcork@gmail.com) and find me on [LinkedIn]().

This portfolio uses Tom Johnson's Documentation theme for Jeckyll. I strongly recommend interested tech writers to check out [Tom's technical writing blog](http://idratherbewriting.com) and also the [Documentation theme itself](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll).
