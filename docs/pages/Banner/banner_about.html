<p>I'm a lead tech writer at OpenText with 14+ years of experience in technical documentation. I mainly work on IT Service Management products and a Kubernetes-based container orchestration platform.</p>

<p>Also an occasional cycling coach and one-time archaeologist.</p>

<p>You can contact me at <a href= "mailto: edcork@gmail.com">edcork@gmail.com</a> and find me on <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardcork">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>This portfolio uses Tom Johnson's Documentation theme for Jeckyll. I strongly recommend interested tech writers to check out <a href= "http://idratherbewriting.com">Tom's technical writing blog</a> and also the <a href= "https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll">Documentation theme itself</a>.</p>
