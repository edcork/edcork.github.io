# Sample 2: Service Management record models
{: .no_toc }

A model simplifies the creation of records in Service Management. A model is a template that end users can select when creating a new record. Service Management automatically populates fields in the new record using information in the model. For certain record types, a model can even create the tasks necessary to complete a process. Models also help to standardize the process of record creation.

This is useful if you frequently create records with similar information. For example, if you have many similar incidents, an incident model reduces the amount of effort required to create the numerous similar incident records. 

Service Management provides a set of default models. You can also add models as required. If you no longer require a model, you can retire that model.

For more information about working with models in each Service Management module, see the following topics:
