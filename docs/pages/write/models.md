# Service Management record models
{: .no_toc }

A model is a template that end users can select when creating a new record in Service Management. Service Management automatically populates fields in the new record using information in the model. For certain record types, a model can even create the tasks necessary to complete a process. Models also help to standardize the process of record creation and reduce the amount of effort required to create numerous similar records.

Service Management provides a set of default models. You can also add models as required. If you no longer require a model, you can retire that model.

For more information about working with models in each Service Management module, see the following topics:
