<p>To use the Cloud Management Platform (CMP) FinOps solution, firstly you need to retrieve cloud data from the cloud platforms that we support: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>

<p>The CMP FinOps solution uses two types of cloud data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cloud billing data &ndash; The CMP FinOps' cloud cost visualization and optimization functionalities, including cost governance reports, cloud insights, and cloud cost limits, are all based on the retrieved billing data.</li>
	<li>Cloud account data &ndash; The CMP FinOps account management functionality enables you to centrally manage cloud accounts of supported cloud platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to set up two types of integrations to retrieve the cloud data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cloud Cost Data Provider-based integrations that retrieve cloud billing data</li>
	<li>Integration Studio-based integrations that import cloud account data</li>
</ul>

<p>See these topics for how to set up the integrations to retrieve cloud data from each cloud platform:&nbsp;</p>
