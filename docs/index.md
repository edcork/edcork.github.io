I'm a lead tech writer, formerly at OpenText. Bolstered by a PhD-level background in research and analysis, I have over 15 years of experience helping enterprise software companies transform dense technical information into clear, user-focused documentation. I specialize in information architecture projects such as decluttering legacy doc sets into lean, SEO-friendly help centers.  

I have primarily documented IT Service Management products and a Kubernetes-based container orchestration platform, and used tools such as MediaWiki, Confluence, MadCap Flare, XMetaL, Subversion, and GitHub.

This portfolio is built with Markdown and a Jekyll theme, then published on GitHub Pages following a 'docs-as-code' workflow.

I'm also an occasional cycling coach and one-time archaeologist.

## Highlights 

### Writing: [OMT Installation](/pages/write/install_landing.html)

These pages taken from a product's installation section showcase writing for multiple audiences. The section's [landing page](/pages/write/install_landing.html) and [main flow of topics](/pages/write/install_prereq_tasks.html) contain sufficient information for expert Kubernetes admins to install the product. Each task in these pages links to [a detailed "how-to" topic](/pages/write/create_sudouser.html) that walks admins new to Kubernets through the steps to configure their environment.   

### Editing:  [Integration guide](/pages/edit/edit3.html)

This topic showcases restructuring content for improved clarity.

### Design: [Online help restructure](/pages/design/help_restructure.html)

A substantial information architecture project that converted a poorly organized internal wiki into a public-facing help center.
